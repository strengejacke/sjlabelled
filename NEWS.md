  avoid errors when writing the data file.

## General

* Update code to the new class-attribute `haven_labelled` from the **haven**-package.

## Bug fixes

* The `read_*()`-functions get a `verbose`-argument, to show or hide the progressbar when imported datasets are converted.

## Bug fixes

* Due to changes in the _broom_ and _lmerTest_ packages, tidiers did no longer work for `lmerModLmerTest` objects.

# sjlabelled 1.0.12

## General

* `get_dv_labels()` and `get_term_labels()` now support _clmm_-objects (package **ordinal**) and _stanmvreg_-objects (package **rstanarm**).

# sjlabelled 1.0.9

## General

* Deprecated `set_note()` and `get_note()`, because there is already an R base function for this purpose: `comment()`.
* Improved performance of functions, at the cost of removing support for the _foreign_ package. _sjlabelled_ now only supports labelled data from package _haven_.

## Changes to functions

* `get_term_labels()` gets a `prefix`-argument to prefix the returned labels of categorical variable either with the related variable name or label.

## Bug fixes

* `get_dv_labels()` no longer returns `"NULL"` for multivariate-response-models fitted with _brms_.

# sjlabelled 1.0.8

## General

* Removed `lbl_df()`, because printing tibbles now depends on pkg _pillar_ and was revised substantially, so maintainace of `lbl_df()` is too extensive.

# sjlabelled 1.0.7

* `convert_case()` is now exported, for usage in other packages as well.
* Remove `protect`-argument from internal case conversion (affects `get_term_labels()` and `get_dv_labels()`), in preparation for forthcoming *snakecase*-package update.

# sjlabelled 1.0.5

## General

* Fixed issue for *lme* and *gls* objects in `get_term_labels()` and `get_dv_labels()`.

* Minor fix to avoid warning when using `as_numeric()`.

## Changes to functions

* `get_label()`, `get_term_labels()` and `get_dv_labels()` get a `case`-argument, to convert labels into any case, using the [snakecase](https://cran.r-project.org/package=snakecase)-package.

# sjlabelled 1.0.1

## General

* Removed function 'var_rename()', which is in pkg 'sjmisc'.

## New functions

* `get_term_labels()` and `get_dv_labels()` to retrieve term labels from regression models.
